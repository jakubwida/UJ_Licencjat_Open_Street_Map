GENERAL:
1: osm app parses file, creating Node Way Relation instances in dictionaries in OSM app
2: Node way and Relatin contain all tags and everything from osm map
3: Node Way and Relation have shapely objects approprieate to their geometry
4: Node Way and Relation are filtered by geometry and tags
5: Clustering App takes in shapely points and returns lists consisting of clustered objects. may take in lists of objects for machine learning
6: Visualisation may take in all shapely objects and print them. may take in lists for certain color

simplified:

Parser & Filter:
>parse files to Node Way Relation w tags & shapely geo objects
>filters them by geometry & tags
>capable of returning lists of points

Clustering
>takes in shapely points (+parameter in function for significance) alone and in lists (for machine learning) 
>returns same objects, but in lists/dictionaries, whatever for clustering

Visualisation:
>takes in all shapely objects and draws them
>also responsible for txt printing of clusters
