GENERAL:

Parser & Filter:
>parse files to Node Way Relation w tags & shapely geo objects
>filters them by geometry & tags
>capable of returning lists of points

Clustering
>takes in shapely points (+parameter in function for significance) alone and in lists (for machine learning) 
>returns same objects, but in lists/dictionaries, whatever for clustering

Visualisation:
>takes in all shapely objects and draws them
>also responsible for txt printing of clusters

//todo:
1. geo objects for parser & filter
